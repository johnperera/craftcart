An e-commerce web application for local artisans.
In today's fast-paced and globalized market, many local artisans struggle to showcase and sell their handmade products to a wider audience. While large e-commerce platforms dominate the retail landscape, they often come with high fees and strict policies that make it difficult for smaller vendors to thrive. Our project, CraftCart, aims to address this problem by creating a dedicated e-commerce web application tailored specifically for local artisans.
CraftCart will be a platform where artisans can create online stores, list their handcrafted products, and manage orders efficiently. Customers can browse by category, search for unique handmade items, and make purchases securely. The platform will be simple, user-friendly, and mobile-responsive, ensuring accessibility for all users.
We chose this project because it supports local talent and entrepreneurship, provides technical challenges that reflect real-world job requirements, and offers opportunities to apply what we’ve learned in frontend and backend development. Through this project, we’ll gain experience building a full-stack web application while making a meaningful social impact.
By working on CraftCart, we will not only improve our coding and collaboration skills but also build a portfolio project that demonstrates our readiness for jobs in software development, UI/UX design, and e-commerce platforms.
